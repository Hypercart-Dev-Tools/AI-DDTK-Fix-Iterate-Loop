# 4x4 Dashboard - Strategic Goals & Weekly Checklist
A simple, actionable framework to prioritize and track engineering tasks. Focus on alignment, transparency, continuous improvement, and increasing clarity for everyone. This document does not replace your project management tools. It is meant to be a simple, actionable checklist to help you focus on the most important tasks for the week.

# About the Current Project
AI-DDTK (AI Driven Development ToolKit) is a central, install-once toolkit used across WordPress projects to standardize AI agent guidance, security practices, and developer workflows (e.g., WPCC scanning, runtime perf profiling, AJAX endpoint testing).

This week’s focus is wrapping up the doc consolidation work reflected in `CHANGELOG.md` (v1.0.5) and keeping the release notes clean and maintainable.

---

## 1. Strategic Backlog
**Maximum of 4 items. Focus on long-term goals and impactful improvements.**

1. - [ ] Ship native `.wpcignore` support in WPCC (reduce recursive scans; unblock repo-wide scanning)
2. - [ ] Harden “end-to-end” audit workflow docs into an executable recipe (scan → triage → report → issue)
3. - [ ] Stabilize install/paths so docs always match reality (`~/bin/ai-ddtk/` expectations, tool discovery, troubleshooting)
4. - [ ] Improve release hygiene (consistent SemVer sections, no orphan sections, lightweight “what changed” summaries)

---

## 2. Current Week
**Active tasks for the week. Maximum of 4 items.**

> **Tip:** If your team frequently handles urgent issues, consider reserving 1-2 slots for hotfixes. Otherwise, use all 4 slots for planned work.

- [x] Cleanup `CHANGELOG.md` structure (add `1.0.5` section, remove duplicates/orphans)
- [ ] Confirm `/temp` guidance is consistent across docs (AGENTS + README + temp/README) and matches `.gitignore`
- [ ] Validate WPCC self-scan workaround messaging (avoid recursion; document recommended scan targets)
- [ ] Triage doc set after merges (ensure deprecated docs are either removed or clearly redirected)

---

## 3. Previous Week
**Review completed, deferred, or blocked tasks from the prior week.**

- [x] Added `/temp` structure + root `.gitignore` rules for sensitive data handling (v1.0.5)
- [x] Consolidated AI agent “system instructions” into `AGENTS.md` to reduce drift (v1.0.5)
- [x] Refined and re-linked `fix-iterate-loop.md` across docs (v1.0.5)
- [x] Improved WP AJAX Test functionality and docs (nonce support + auth/SSL fixes) (v1.0.5)

---

## 4. Recent Lessons Learned
**Capture insights to improve processes and avoid repeating mistakes.**

1. Changelog structure matters: duplicate headings and orphan sections make releases hard to trust and harder to automate.
2. “Single source of truth” docs reduce maintenance: merging scattered instructions into `AGENTS.md` prevents silent divergence.
3. Tooling needs safe defaults: recursive/self scans are easy foot-guns; explicit ignore patterns and target scoping should be first-class.
4. Avoid hardcoded machine-specific paths in docs; prefer `~/bin/...` or relative paths so guidance works across environments.

## How to Use This Template

For detailed guidance on the 4x4 framework, see the [README](README.md).

**Quick tips:**
- Update this document weekly (move "Current Week" to "Previous Week" and plan your new week)
- Limit each section to 4 items maximum to maintain focus
- Capture lessons learned immediately while they're fresh
- Link to detailed tasks in your project management tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
