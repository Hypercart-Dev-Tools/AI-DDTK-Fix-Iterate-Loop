# AI-DDTK - AI Driven Development ToolKit

> Version: 1.0.5

Testing + Automation → Bugs → Fixes → Testing → Deploy

## Overview

An early work in progress centralized toolkit for AI-driven WordPress development, designed to be called from any project.

**At the center:**
- VS Code AI Agents (Claude Code, Augment, Codex, etc.) with tuned system instructions
- MCP server integration for tool orchestration

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Used By | Install |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Git** | Cloning AI-DDTK & WPCC updates | `brew install git` |
| **Node.js** | WP Code Check scanner | `brew install node` |
| **Python 3** | AI triage, HTML reports | `brew install python3` |
| **Composer** | PHPStan (optional) | `brew install composer` |
| **GitHub CLI** | Issue creation (optional) | `brew install gh` |
| **Playwright** | Browser automation (optional) | `npm install -g playwright` |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone to your bin directory
git clone https://github.com/Hypercart-Dev-Tools/AI-DDTK.git ~/bin/ai-ddtk
cd ~/bin/ai-ddtk

# Install (adds to PATH)
./install.sh

# Set up WP Code Check
./install.sh setup-wpcc

# Activate in current shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
wpcc --help

# (Optional) Set up temp folder structure for credentials, reports, etc.
# The folder structure is already created; this just shows what's available
ls temp/
```

**Note**: The `/temp` folder is for storing sensitive data (credentials, API keys, reports) that should never be committed to git. See [`temp/README.md`](temp/README.md) for complete usage guidelines.

## Usage from Any Project

```bash
# Run WPCC against a plugin
wpcc analyze ./wp-content/plugins/my-plugin

# Run WP-CLI via Local
local-wp my-site plugin list
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **WP Code Check** | Code review + AI triage with MCP server |
| **WP AJAX Test** | AJAX endpoint testing and validation |
| **[Fix-Iterate Loop](fix-iterate-loop.md)** | Autonomous test-verify-fix workflow for AI agents |
| **local-wp** | WP-CLI wrapper for Local by Flywheel |
| **Playwright** | Headless browser automation |
| **PixelMatch** | Visual regression testing |

## Maintenance Commands

```bash
./install.sh              # First-time setup
./install.sh update       # Pull latest AI-DDTK
./install.sh update-wpcc  # Pull latest WP Code Check
./install.sh status       # Show versions and status
./install.sh uninstall    # Remove PATH entries
```

## For AI Agents

See `install.sh` for detailed guidance on:
- Git subtree operations for updating WPCC
- GitHub CLI commands for checking updates
- Architecture and maintenance notes

## WPCC: Project Templates

Set up once, reuse forever. Templates save plugin/theme paths and scan settings so you can re-run audits with a single command.

```bash
# First time: auto-detects plugin name, version, and GitHub repo
wpcc run gravityforms
# → Template not found. Create from current directory? [y/N] y
# ✓ Created! Detected: Gravity Forms v2.7.1

# Every time after: one command runs the full workflow
# Ask AI: "Run gravityforms end to end"
```

That single command triggers the complete pipeline:

```
Scan → AI Triage → HTML Report → GitHub Issue
       (filters       (with AI        (with checkboxes,
       false           summary         ready for Jira/
       positives)      at top)         Linear/Asana too)
```

Templates handle flexible naming — `Gravity Forms`, `gravity-forms`, and `gravityforms` all resolve to the same config. See the [Template Guide](tools/wp-code-check/dist/HOWTO-TEMPLATES.md) for details.

### More WPCC Features

| Feature | Description | How to Use |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **AI-Assisted Triage** | Automated false positive detection | Ask AI: "Triage this scan" or "Run X end to end" |
| **GitHub Issue Creation** | Convert findings to trackable issues | Ask AI: "Create issue for scan" |
| **IRL Audit Mode** | Annotate real code for pattern library | See [Audit Guide](tools/wp-code-check/dist/tests/irl/_AI_AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) |
| **Multi-Platform Export** | Export issues to Jira, Linear, Asana, Trello | Issues saved to `dist/issues/` for copy/paste |

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Basic scan (no template needed)
wpcc --paths ./wp-content/plugins/my-plugin --format json

# Show all available features and templates
wpcc --features
```

## WordPress Development Guidelines

AI-DDTK includes comprehensive WordPress development guidelines in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for AI coding assistants.

### 🎯 Philosophy: Works Great by Default, Customizable for Experts

**For beginners**: Follow the patterns in AGENTS.md — they represent WordPress community best practices and will keep your code maintainable from day one.

**For senior developers**: The guidelines are Hypercart's opinionated defaults. Fork `AGENTS.md` and customize to match your team's standards.

### What's Covered

| Section | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Security** | Required | Nonces, sanitization, escaping, sensitive data handling |
| **Performance** | Required | Caching, query optimization, resource limits |
| **WordPress APIs** | Required | Hooks, filters, database access, WP-CLI |
| **SOLID Principles** | Opinionated | Architecture patterns with rationale and customization guidance |
| **DRY & State Management** | Opinionated | Helper patterns, single contract writers, FSM guidance |
| **Scope Control** | Opinionated | When to refactor, preservation vs. optimization trade-offs |
| **Documentation** | Opinionated | PHPDoc standards, versioning, CHANGELOG requirements |
| **Testing** | Opinionated | Backward compatibility, Fix-Iterate Loop pattern |

### Customization Examples

The guide includes team-specific customization examples for:
- **Startups** - Move fast, relax DRY requirements
- **Enterprise** - Strict documentation, lower FSM thresholds
- **Open Source** - Package tags, unit test requirements
- **Agencies** - Strict scope control, detailed changelogs
- **Maintenance** - Zero scope creep, preservation-first

**See the full guide**: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

## Troubleshooting

**`wpcc: command not found`** — Reload your shell config, then retry:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```
If that doesn't work, verify the install:
```bash
~/bin/ai-ddtk/install.sh status
```

**`WPCC not found` or `setup-wpcc` needed** — Run setup again:
```bash
cd ~/bin/ai-ddtk && ./install.sh setup-wpcc
```

**WPCC stalls when scanning AI-DDTK itself** — The repository includes embedded WPCC via git subtree. Use exclusions:
```bash
# Exclude embedded tools (recommended)
wpcc --paths . --exclude "tools/,.git/,node_modules/" --format json

# Or scan only specific directories
wpcc --paths "bin/ recipes/ templates/" --format json
```

> **Note**: A `.wpcignore` file is included in the repository for future WPCC versions that support automatic exclusions.
