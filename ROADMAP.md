Yes, absolutely. The WPCC integration now provides a **concrete, working example** of what AI-DDTK can be — not just a collection of scripts, but an **orchestration layer** that makes AI agents more effective at development tasks.

## How WPCC Frames AI-DDTK's Identity

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "A folder with some wrapper scripts" | "An AI-aware toolkit with orchestrated workflows" |
| AI agents had to figure out tools themselves | AI agents have explicit instructions and decision trees |
| Tools were isolated utilities | Tools have multi-phase workflows with handoffs |
| No discoverability | `--features` flag, AGENTS.md orchestration section |

The key shift: **AI-DDTK isn't just tools — it's tools + instructions for AI agents to use them effectively.**

---

## Future Opportunities

### 1. **More WordPress Tools with AI Orchestration**

| Tool | What It Does | AI Orchestration Value |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| **WP-CLI via Local** | Database, plugin, theme management | "Migrate this site" → multi-step workflow |
| **PHPStan/Psalm** | Static type analysis | Chain with WPCC: security → types → performance |
| **WP Test Utils** | Unit/integration testing | "Write tests for this plugin" → scaffold + run |
| **Playwright** | E2E browser testing | "Test the checkout flow" → record + assert |

### 2. **Cross-Tool Orchestration Patterns**

```
User: "Audit this plugin completely"
    │
    ├─ WPCC scan (security/performance)
    ├─ PHPStan (type safety)
    ├─ Playwright (E2E smoke test)
    └─ Consolidated report with all findings
```

This is where AI-DDTK becomes more than the sum of its parts.

### 3. **Project Templates at AI-DDTK Level**

Not just WPCC templates, but **project-level templates**:

```yaml
# ~/.ai-ddtk/projects/client-site.yaml
name: "Client Production Site"
wordpress_path: "/Users/me/Local Sites/client-prod/app/public"
tools:
  wpcc:
    template: "client-theme"
    auto_triage: true
  playwright:
    base_url: "https://client.local"
    tests: ["checkout", "login", "search"]
  backup:
    schedule: "before-deploy"
```

### 4. **MCP Server Integration**

The `mcp/` folder in your structure hints at this. MCP (Model Context Protocol) would let AI agents:
- Discover available tools dynamically
- Get structured responses instead of parsing CLI output
- Chain tools with proper error handling

```
AI Agent ←→ MCP Server ←→ WPCC, Playwright, WP-CLI, etc.
```

### 5. **Workflow Recipes**

Pre-built multi-tool workflows:

| Recipe | Tools Used | Trigger |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Pre-Deploy Audit** | WPCC + PHPStan + Playwright | "Run pre-deploy checks" |
| **New Plugin Setup** | Scaffold + WPCC template + Git hooks | "Set up new plugin project" |
| **Bug Investigation** | WP-CLI logs + WPCC scan + DB query | "Debug this error" |
| **Performance Baseline** | WPCC + Lighthouse + Query Monitor | "Benchmark this page" |

### 6. **Learning/Feedback Loop**

Track which AI triage decisions were correct:
- When user marks a "false positive" as actually a real issue → improve patterns
- When user accepts AI recommendations → reinforce those patterns
- Build a local knowledge base of project-specific patterns

### 7. **Multi-Project Dashboard**

For developers managing multiple WordPress sites:
```
ai-ddtk status --all

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI-DDTK Project Status                                      │
├─────────────────┬──────────┬─────────────┬─────────────────┤
│ Project         │ Last Scan│ Issues      │ Next Action     │
├─────────────────┼──────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ client-prod     │ 2 days   │ 3 confirmed │ Review issues   │
│ staging-site    │ 1 week   │ 0           │ Scan recommended│
│ dev-playground  │ Never    │ -           │ Create template │
└─────────────────┴──────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### 8. **Performance Profiling Integration** ✅ In Progress

Runtime performance analysis to complement WPCC's static analysis:

| Tool | Purpose | AI Orchestration |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **WP Performance Timer** | Runtime instrumentation | "Profile this page" workflow |
| **Query Monitor** | Query analysis | Chain with timer data |
| **Lighthouse** | Core Web Vitals | Full-stack performance audit |

**Status**: Added to AGENTS.md (v2.3.0) with WPCC → Timer pipeline documentation.

**Recipe**: See `recipes/performance-audit.md` for complete workflow.

**Key Value**: WPCC finds *potential* issues (static), Performance Timer *proves* impact (runtime).

---

### 9. **AJAX Endpoint Testing** 📝 Planned

Lightweight WordPress AJAX testing without browser automation:

| Feature | Purpose | AI Orchestration |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Direct endpoint testing** | Test wp_ajax_* actions | "Test this AJAX endpoint" workflow |
| **Auto-authentication** | Handle nonces/cookies | Load from `/temp/auth.json` |
| **Batch testing** | Multiple endpoints | Regression testing before deploy |
| **JSON I/O** | Structured output | AI can parse/debug responses |

**Design Principle**: **Centralized by default, local copy when needed**
- AI agents call `~/bin/ai-ddtk/bin/wp-ajax-test` directly
- Create project-specific wrapper only if customization required
- Wrapper calls centralized tool (never duplicate code)

**Status**: Spec drafted in `tools/wp-ajax-test/SPEC.md`

**Key Value**: Fills gap between WPCC (static) and Playwright (heavy E2E). Lightweight integration testing.

**When to use**:
- ✅ Quick AJAX endpoint verification
- ✅ Debugging AJAX failures
- ✅ Regression testing after changes
- ❌ Full browser flows → Use Playwright
- ❌ Load testing → Use Apache Bench

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Low Effort, High Value)

1. ~~**Document the vision**~~ ✅ Added to README (WPCC Advanced Features)

2. **Add `local-wp` to AGENTS.md** — Similar orchestration guidance for WP-CLI operations

3. ~~**Create a `recipes/` folder**~~ ✅ Created with `performance-audit.md`

4. **MCP exploration** — Prototype a simple MCP server that exposes WPCC

---

## Completed

- ✅ WPCC feature discovery (`wpcc --features`)
- ✅ WPCC orchestration in AGENTS.md
- ✅ Performance Profiling integration (AGENTS.md + recipe)
